# REACT NATIVE TUTORIAL

By Militsa Neykova & Dan Beebe

## Introduction

React Native is a framework used to construct mobile applications written in JavaScript, utilizing the React library to create the user interface. 

According to Facebook's documentation on React Native:

"With React Native, you don't build a 'mobile web app', an 'HTML5 app', or a 'hybrid app'. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React."

In other words, although React Native apps are written in JavaScript, their structure is essentially the same as other apps.

This tutorial includes sections on: (i) why/when you might want to use React Native; (ii) getting started with React Native; (iii) specific code examples; and (iv) resources for further reading.

## Why Use React Native?

Althoug the React apps are fundametaly building blocks as a native app, they are better and faster. The applications are much easier to code, less expensive, save a lot of time to build and they are open sourse.
   

## Getting Started

To start using React Native, you should install the React Native npm package by running the following code in your terminal:

        npm install -g react-native-cli

You'll also want to install yarn to help with setting up your React Native App, so run the following too:

        npm install -g yarn

To initialize a new React Native app, go into the folder where you want to create your app and run the following command:

        react-native init newAppName
